how to connect to hue:

hit: https://www.meethue.com/api/nupnp

parse the json for the value of "internalipaddress" of the first (and in our case only) bridge, at time of writing it is "10.0.1.12"

you can go to this url to test things:
http://10.0.1.12/debug/clip.html

intro info is here:
http://www.developers.meethue.com/documentation/getting-started

we are using the id newdeveloper, which is already set up on our bridge

the form to turn off the light is as follows:

IP_OF_BRIDGE/api/newdeveloper/lights/ID_OF_LIGHT/state

PUT request with value {"on":false}  <-- this is in the json currently

to get the name of the lights use a get request to:

IP_OF_BRIDGE/api/newdeveloper/lights

look for "name", id is the second to top level division
